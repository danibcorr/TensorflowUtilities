**üõ†Ô∏è TensorFlowUtilities Repo**

# üöÄ Summary

Welcome to my toolbox for TensorFlow! This repository is a personal space where I share unofficial implementations, including layers, models, data augmentation techniques, and more. The goal is to collaborate on practical solutions that I've found useful for my own projects with TensorFlow.

# üé® Content

- **data_augmentation:** A folder containing various data augmentation techniques.
- **data_manipulation:** A folder containing tools and scripts for manipulating datasets.
- **data_visualization:** A folder with tools for visualizing data in various formats.
- **layers:** A folder containing layers/blocks useful for the development of Deep Learning models.
- **losses:** A folder containing different loss functions used in training models.
- **models:** A folder with pre-built models or scripts to build custom models.
- **optimizers:** A folder containing different optimization algorithms for training models.
- **schedulers:** A folder with learning rate schedulers to adjust the learning rate during training.
- **utils:** A folder containing utilities required in the previous folders that can be used at a general level.

*(As new tools, models, and techniques are added, this section will be updated to showcase the latest in the repository.)*

# ‚ú® Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the different folders to discover the tools and techniques.
3. Integrate the implementations into your TensorFlow project.
